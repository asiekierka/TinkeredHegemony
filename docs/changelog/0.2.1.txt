Additions:

* Hide all JEI recipes which output a disabled vanilla tool.
    * Recipes which only take one in as input are not disabled by default.
      They are often responsible for smelting, etc. You can force disabling
      these with an additional configuration option.

Bugs fixed:

* Fix being able to create disabled vanilla tools from Tinkers' recipes.
* Fix crash with Construct's Armory armor recipe replacements.
